Code and data for characterizing water column mixing regimes in ponds and comparing the influence of maximum salinity, surface temperature, Secchi depth, maximum depth, and surface area by generalized linear regression.

Pond_mixing_regime_profile_data.csv contains depth profile data with rows corresponding to unique entries and columns corresponding to Site (sampling location name), Date (sampling date), Time (sampling time), Event (sampling month), Parameter (water quality parameter), Units (water quality parameter unit), Depth (measurement depth), and Value (measurement value).

Pond_mixing_regime_site_data.csv contains site data with rows corresponding to sampling locations with columns corresponding to Site (sampling location name), Sample_Description (sampling location name distinguishing location), Latitude (sampling location latitude), Longitude (sampling location longitude), Subwatershed (sampling location subwatershed), D-Chloride (dissolved chloride concentration), T-Sodium (total sodium concentration), T-Phosphorus (total phosphorus concentration), Surcae.area (sampling location surface area in m2).

Code presented in Pond_mixing_regime_R_code.R.
